# `tar`

## INSTALLATION


```bash
#ℹ︎ installation of `tar`
❯ *comes pre-installed*
```



## NOTES

`tar` only makes a single file out of multiple files, it doesn’t do compression unless combined a compression program such as `gzip` or `bzip2` (which you can call from within `tar` by using the `-z` or `-j` options, respectively). `zip` combines both the archiving and compression in one program.

## SEE

    tar(1)

## SEEALSO

    zip(1), gzip(1), bzip2(1)
