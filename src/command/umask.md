# `umask`

## BRIEF

    ❯ umask [-p] [-S] [mode]

The user file-creation mask is set to `mode`. If `mode` begins with a digit, it is interpreted as an octal number; otherwise it is interpreted as a symbolic mode mask similar to that accepted by `chmod(1)`. If `mode` is omitted, the current value of the mask is printed.

    -S
        print mask in symbolic form; the default output is an octal number

    -p
        output is in a form that may be reused as input. The return status is `0` if the `mode` was successfully changed or if no `mode` argument was supplied, and false otherwise.

## INSTALLATION


```bash
#ℹ︎ installation
❯ *comes builtin*
```


## USECASES

----
#### To get/print user file-creation permission classes mask:


```bash
#ℹ︎ get/print user file-creation permission classes mask, as octal notation number
❯ umask
```


```bash
#ℹ︎ get/print user file-creation permission classes mask, as symbolic mode characters
❯ umask -S
```


----
#### To set user file-creation permission classes mask:


```bash
#ℹ︎ set/modify user file-creation permission classes mask, as octal notation number
❯ umask 0077
```


```bash
#ℹ︎ set/modify user file-creation permission classes mask, as symbolic mode characters
❯ umask u=rwx,g=,o=x
```



## NOTES

### Understand

When creating a file the system applies the `umask` to the default permissions of `666` (directories) and `777` (files) to obtain the mode that each is assigned by default. To calculate the permission bits for a new directory or file, we just subtract the `umask` value from the default value:

    ❯ umask 022   # OR: umask u=rwx,g=w,o=w

    666 - 022 = 644 = rw-r--r--
    777 - 022 = 755 = rw-r-xr-x

Some helpful tables:
