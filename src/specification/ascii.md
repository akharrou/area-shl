# ASCII

## BRIEF

American Standard Code For Information Interchange (ASCII), is a standard data-transmission code that is used by smaller and less-powerful computers to represent both textual data (letters, numbers, and punctuation marks) and noninput-device commands (control characters).

Each character is mapped to a number code that the computer understands as its binary (base 2) equivalent.
