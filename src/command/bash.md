## PATHS

Path | Description
- | -
📂 `/bin/bash` | `bash` executable file location path
📂 `/etc/inputrc` | The system-wide Readline initialization file where you can configure the command line bell-style.
📂 `~/.inputrc` | User Readline initialization file.
📂 `/etc/bashrc` | System-wide login shell environment configuration initialization/startup file.
📂 `/etc/profile` | System-wide login shell environment configuration initialization/startup file. This file is also sourced for the `sh`, `ksh`, and `dash` login shells.
📂 `/etc/profile.d/` | Directory containing initialization/startup files that configure system-wide behavior of specific programs. A loop in `/etc/profile` would source everything within this directory.
📂 `~/.bash_profile` | Preferred user login shell environment configuration initialization/startup file.
📂 `~/.bash_login` | User login shell environment configuration initialization/startup file. This file is sourced in the absence of `~/.bash_profile`.
📂 `~/.profile` | User login shell environment configuration initialization/startup file. This file is sourced in the absence of `~/.bash_profile`, and `~/.bash_login`. Also, this file specifically is also sourced for the `sh`, `ksh`, and `dash` login shells. It can hold the same configurations, which are then also accessible by other shells. Mind that other shells might not understand the Bash syntax.
📂 `~/.bash_logout` | User login shell cleanup/shutdown file, executed when exiting shell. It contains specific instructions for the logout procedure.
📂 `~/.bashrc` | User non-login shell environment configuration initialization/startup file.
📂 `~/.bash_history` | Default bash command history file.
