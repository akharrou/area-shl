# Shellscript

## USECASES

----
#### To create a whileloop, to duplicate a file:

    ❯ i=0
    while (( i++ < 100 )); do
      cp test.ogg "test$i.ogg"
    done

----
#### To create an infinite whileloop, to say/speak something out loud:

    ❯ while true; do say "hello world \!" ; done
    ❯ while (( 1 )); do say "hello world \!" ; done

----
#### To create a forloop, to iterate over files and do something with them:

    ❯ for file in **/*; do echo $file; done
    ❯ for file in $(fd --type f); do echo $file; done
    ❯ for file in $(find . -type f);
    do
        echo $file;
    done

----
#### To create a range forloop, to iterate over a sequence of numbers, with variables, with padding:

    ❯ for i in {1..5}; do echo $i; done
    1
    2
    3
    4
    5

    ❯ BEGIN=0; END=5; for i in $(seq $BEGIN $END); do echo $i; done
    1
    2
    3
    4
    5

    ❯ for i in {0001..1010}; do echo $i; done
    ❯ padtowidth=4; for i in $(seq $BEGIN $END); do printf "%0*d\n" $padtowidth $i; done
    0001
    0002
    0095
    0096
    0997
    0998
    1009
    1010
    ...

----
#### To implement a switch-case command:

    ❯ case "$1"
    in
        0) echo "zero found";;
        1) echo "one found";;
        2) echo "two found";;
        3*) echo "something beginning with 3 found";;
    esac

----
#### To turn on debugging:

    ❯ set -x

----
#### To turn off debugging:

    ❯ set +x

----
#### Retrieve N-th piped command exit status:

    ❯ printf "foo" | fgrep "foo" | sed "s/foo/bar/"
    ❯ echo ${PIPESTATUS[0]}   # replace 0 with N

----
#### To create a lockfile:

    ❯ ( set -o noclobber; echo > my.lock ) || echo "Failed to create lock file"

## RECIPIES

----
#### To rename files in folder with name and (padded) counter:

    ❯ i=1; padtowidth=4; for file in *; do tmp=$(printf "%0*d\n" $padtowidth $i); ((i++)); mv $file "Article - $tmp"; done

- Prepending commands with `\` bypasses any aliases. E.g.: `\stat`, `\ls`.
- Common dummy variables: foobar, foo, bar, baz, qux, quux, quuz, corge, grault, garply, waldo, fred, plugh

### Types

- **Integers**

    ```bash
    ❯ declare -i age=23.2
    ❯ echo $age
    ❯ 23
    ```

- **Floats**

    ```bash
    ❯ declare -F age=23.2
    ❯ echo $age
    23.2000000000
    ```
    ```bash
    ❯ declare -E age=23.2
    ❯ echo $age
    2.320000000e+01
    ```

- **Strings**

    ```bash
    ❯ declare name="John Doe"
    ❯ echo $name
    John Doe
    ```

- **Arrays**

    ```bash
    ❯ declare nums=(0 1 2 3 4 5)
    ❯ echo ${#num}
    6
    ❯ echo ${nums[1]} && echo ${nums[1,2]} && echo ${nums[3,-1]}
    0
    0 1
    2 3 4 5
    ❯ echo ${nums[*]}
    0 1 2 3 4 5
    ❯ echo ${nums[*]:2}
    2 3 4 5
    ❯ echo ${nums[*]:2:2}
    2 3
    ```
    ```bash
    ❯ declare team=(john "steve jobs" tim laura becka)
    ❯ echo ${team[2]} && echo ${team[4]}
    steve jobs
    laura
    ❯ echo ${#team}
    5
    ❯ echo $team || echo ${team[@]} || echo ${team[*]}
    john steve jobs tim laura becka
    ❯ for person in $team; do echo $person; done
    john
    steve jobs
    tim
    laura
    becka
    ```

- **Associative Arrays** *(a.k.a maps, hashtables, hashmaps, dictionnaries)*

    ```bash
    ❯ declare -A menu
    ❯ menu[breakfast]="coffee with eggs"
    ❯ menu[dinner]="lasagna"
    ❯ menu[supper]="caesar salad"
    ❯ echo ${menu[dinner]}
    lasagna
    ❯ echo ${menu[*]}
    lasagna coffee with eggs caesar salad eggs
    ❯ echo ${#menu[*]}
    4
    ❯ for item in ${menu[*]}; do echo $item; done
    lasagna
    coffee with eggs
    caesar salad
    eggs
    ```

>- There is no notion of order in an associative array.
>- `bash` does have Boolean expressions in terms of comparison and conditions. That said, what you can declare and compare in `bash` are strings and numbers. That’s it. Wherever you see `true` or `false` in `bash`, it’s either a string or a command/builtin which is only used for its exit code.

### Relational operators

### Control operators

#### List terminators

| Syntax | Semantics                 |
| ------ | ------------------------- |
| `;`    | command terminator        |
| `&`    | run command in background |

    ❯ COMMAND1 ; COMMAND2
    ❯ COMMAND1 & COMMAND2

#### Logical operators

| Syntax | Semantics                                                       |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `&&`   | AND operator, run each command if previous exits successfully   |
| `||`   | OR operator, run commands in order until one exits successfully |
| `!`    | NOT operator, negates the return status of a command            |

    ❯ COMMAND1 && COMMAND2
    ❯ COMMAND1 || COMMAND2
    ❯ ! COMMAND

#### Pipe operators

| Syntax | Semantics                                               |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `|`    | passes `stdout` of one command to `stdin` of another    |
| `|&`   | passes `stdout` and `stderr` of one cammand to `stdin` of another |

    ❯ COMMAND1 | COMMAND2
    ❯ COMMAND1 |& COMMAND2

>- `|&` is shorthand for `2>&1 |` in `bash` and `zsh`.
>- A command built from the pipe operator is called a pipeline.

#### Other list punctuation

| Syntax | Semantics                                |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| `;;`   | marks end of a `case` statement          |
| `;&`   | marks to fall through to the next case   |
| `;;&`  | marks to go on and test subsequent cases |

### Redirection operators

| Syntax | Semantics                                                 |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<`    | gives input to a command, file is open in read-only mode  |
| `<>`   | gives input to a command, file is open in read+write mode |
| `>`    | directs the output of a command into a file. if the file exists, its contents will be overwritten and if it does not exist it will be created. often used to choose whether something should be printed to standard error or standard output.
| `>|` | directs the output of a command into a file, but overwrites target, even if the shell has been configured to refuse overwriting (with `set -C` or `set -o noclobber`). if file exists, replaces content, else creates file.
| `>>` | directs the output of a command into a file, but if the target file exists, it is appended to the file.
| `&>`, `&>>`, `>&`, `>>&`, | redirect both standard error and standard output, replacing or appending, respectively.
| `>&-`, `<&-`  | -
| `x>&y`, `x<&y`  | -
| `<<`  | a "here document", it often used to print multi-line strings. it takes `Text` as input, that is, everything from the first occurrence of `WORD` to the next occurrence of `WORD`. WORD is often "EoF" or variations thereof.
| `<<<`  | "here strings", similar to "here documents", but intended for a single line.

    ❯ COMMAND < file.txt
    ❯ COMMAND <> file.txt

    ❯ COMMAND > stdout.txt
    ❯ COMMAND 1>stdout.txt 2>stderror.txt

    ❯ COMMAND < file.txt > stdout.txt 2> stderror.txt
    ❯ COMMAND < file.txt 1>stdout.txt 2> stderror.txt

    ❯ COMMAND >| stdout.txt
    ❯ COMMAND >> out.txt
    ❯ COMMAND &> stdout_and_stderror.txt
    ❯ COMMAND &>> stdout_and_stderror.txt

>- When surrounded by digits (e.g. `1>&2`) or `-` on the right side (e.g. `4>&-`) either redirects the file descriptor, or closes it, respectively.
>- The `&>` variant originates in `bash`, while the `>&` variant comes from `csh` (decades earlier). They both conflict with other POSIX shell operators and should not be used in portable sh scripts.

    ❯ COMMAND << WORD
    heredoc> text
    heredoc> WORD

    ❯ cat << EOF
    heredoc> Something really nice and long for
    heredoc> everyone to read.
    heredoc> EOF
    Something really nice and long for
    everyone to read.

    ❯ COMMAND << WORD | COMMAND1 ...
    pipe heredoc> text
    pipe heredoc> WORD

    ❯ cat << eof | sed "s/ /_/g"
    pipe heredoc> Something really nice and long for
    pipe heredoc> everyone to read.
    pipe heredoc> eof
    Something_really_nice_and_long_for
    everyone_to_read.

    ❯ COMMAND <<< WORD
    ❯ echo <<< eof something really \"nice and enjoyable\"
    something really "nice and enjoyable"

### Substitution operators

| Syntax | Semantics
| ------ | ---------
| `=COMMAND` | (zsh only); substitutes a command for its full path. behavior can be turned off with `setopt noequals`.
| `$VAR` | access variable value
| `…`, `$(…)` | command substitutions, substitutes a command for its output
| `>(…)` | replaces a process with a named-pipe (FIFO), acting as its input stream, that can be written to.
| `<(…)` | replaces a process with a named-pipe (FIFO), containing its output, that can be read from; although similar in behavior to `=(…)`, it is better in space efficiency, and portability.
| `=(…)` | (zsh only); replaces a process with [the name of] a file, containing its output, that can be written to


```bash
#ℹ︎ get command full path
❯ echo =python3
```

    /usr/local/opt/python@3.9/bin/python3
    ❯ ls -l =echo
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  120848 Jan  1  2020 /bin/echo


```bash
#ℹ︎ get PATH variable value
❯ echo $PATH     
```

    /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin


```bash
#ℹ︎ command substitution, get command output
❯ var=`command...` 
```


```bash
#ℹ︎ command substitution, get command output
❯ var=$(command...)
```



```bash
#ℹ︎ process substitution, get process input named-pipe (fifo)
❯ echo >(echo hi &>/dev/null)      
```

    /dev/fd/16


```bash
#ℹ︎ process substitution, get process output named-pipe (fifo)
❯ echo <(echo hi); cat <(echo hi)  
```

    /dev/fd/14


```bash
#ℹ︎ process substitution, get process output file name
❯ echo =(echo hi); cat =(echo hi)  
```

    /tmp/zshBtzgeO
    hi

### Prompt Customization

When executing interactively, bash displays the primary prompt `PS1` when it is ready to read a command, and the secondary prompt `PS2` when it needs more input to complete a command. Bash displays `PS0` after it reads a command but before executing it. Bash displays `PS4` as described above before tracing each command when the `-x` option is enabled. Bash allows these prompt strings to be customized by inserting a number of backslash-escaped special characters that are decoded as follows:

| Char         | Description                                                   |

| `\]`         | end non-printing character sequence                           |

>- Non-printing character sequences can be used to embed a terminal con­trol sequence into the prompt.

### Shell types

- **Interactive & Non-Interactive**

    **Interactive shells** are shells wherein user interacts with it, using keyboard. For example, the shell you use to type commands is interactive.

    **Non-Interactive shells** are shells wherein users don’t interact with it. For example, when you run a shell-script, or run a command line program, the computer spawns a non-interactive shell to run it in.

- **Login & Non-Login**

    **Login shells** are shells that source/run/execute a set of pre-designated files once at startup/entry/login and at shutdown/exit/logout. For example, `bash` login shells will look for and source `/etc/bashrc`, `/etc/profile`, `.bash_profile` (else `.bash_login`, else `.profile`) at login, and `.bash_logout` at logout; `zsh` login shells will look for and source `/etc/zshenv`, `.zshenv`, `/etc/zprofile`, `.zprofile`, `/etc/zshrc`, `.zshrc`, `/etc/zlogin`, `.zlogin`, at login, and `.zlogout`, `/etc/zlogout` at logout. These whould be the top-level shell that you use in your terminal.

    **Non-login shells** are shells that source/run/execute another set of pre-designated files once at startup/entry/login. For example, `bash` sources `.bashrc` at login; `zsh` sources `/etc/zshenv`, `.zshenv`, `/etc/zshrc` and `.zshrc` at login. These would be sub-shells that you run within your top-level shell.

Shells can be any one of the two combinations of attributes: interactive login shells (the ones you use), interactive non-login shells (sub-shells within login shells), non-interactive login shells

### Pattern matching

| `**/*`            | Matches any directory and sub-directory               |
| `[…]`             | Matches any of the contained characters               |
